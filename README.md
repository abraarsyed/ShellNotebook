# ShellNotebook

Shell Notebook is a project aiming to extend Jupyter Notebook to support Unix Shell commands. The idea is provide an environment similar to the IPython Notebook for newcomers to the Unix Shell, so they can keep logs of the commands they have executed along with the respective outputs, in a single place.  
ShellNotebook will also support other CLI tools, such as git and sqlite3.

### How to get involved?
The project will be developed during the [Mozilla Science Lab Global Sprint](http://www.mozillascience.org/global-sprint-2015), in June 4-5 2015. Your collaboration will be very much appreciated, there are tasks that match a very broad set of skills, and we would enjoy getting to know you and building ShellNotebook together during the hackathon! If you are a Python guru, a graphic designer, a UI/UX expert, a Unix Shell instructor, take a look at the [issues](https://github.com/techministry/ShellNotebook/issues), add your own ideas to the existing ones or create new issues.
